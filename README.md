# Ordinal-Encoding-and-Label-Encoding
In ordinal encoding, each unique category value is assigned an integer value. For example, “red” is 1, “green” is 2, and “blue” is 3. This is called an ordinal encoding or an integer encoding and is easily reversible. Often, integer values starting at zero are used. For some variables, an ordinal encoding may be enough. The integer values have a natural ordered relationship between each other and machine learning algorithms may be able to understand and harness this relationship.Label Encoding refers to converting the labels into a numeric form so as to convert them into the machine-readable form. Machine learning algorithms can then decide in a better way how those labels must be operated. It is an important pre-processing step for the structured dataset in supervised learning.
